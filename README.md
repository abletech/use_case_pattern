# UseCasePattern

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AbleTech/use_case_pattern.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AbleTech/use_case_pattern)

A module that helps you to implement the Use Case design pattern.

This pattern is widely used by the teams at Abletech. We were first introduced to this pattern by Shevaun Coker at RubyConf AU 2015 in Melbourne, Australia. You can read more about this pattern in her blog post A [Case for Use Cases](http://webuild.envato.com/blog/a-case-for-use-cases/), and also in the [video of the presentation](https://rubyconf.eventer.com/rubyconf-australia-2015-1223/a-case-for-use-cases-by-shevaun-coker-1734) that she gave.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'use_case_pattern'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install use_case_pattern

## Basic Usage

When you follow the use case design pattern, you normally define a class with a constructor, and a perform method. You should include the `UseCasePattern` module. Here is a simple example:

```ruby
class NumberMultiplier
  include UseCasePattern

  attr_reader :product

  validates :number1, :number2, presence: true

  def initialize(number1, number2)
    @number1 = number1
    @number2 = number2
  end

  def perform
    @product = @number1 * @number2
  end
end
```

You could call this simple example from a Rails Controller, or anywhere else really. Here is an example:

```ruby
  def multiply
    multiplier = NumberMultiplier.perform(params[:number1], params[:number2])

    if multiplier.success?
      @result = multiplier.result
    else
      redirect_to :new, notice: multiplier.errors.full_messages
    end
  end
```

## Normal workflow

This section defines the expected approach to implementing a class which uses the use case pattern.

### Initialisation

You would normally define a constructor for your use case. The constructor should store any supplied parameters as instance variables. You shouldn't perform any processing or business logic in the constructor.

The constructor is called with the parameters that are passed to the `perform` class method. For example, using the NumberMultiplier defined above, making a call to `NumberMultiplier.perform(1, 2)` will result in the initialiser being called as `initialize(1, 2)`.

### Validation

You should use ActiveModel validators to check that supplied parameters and any other dependencies are correct. You can also write custom validation methods using the [validate method](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/Validations/ClassMethods.html#method-i-validate). Following the standard validation approach, you should add to the `errors` collection if validation fails.

### Execution

The `perform` method is where the execution of the use case should happen. In this method, you should perform all of the processing and business logic of your use case. Results of the execution should be stored as instance variables.

Sometimes during the execution of the `perform` method, an error may occur. You could choose to add to the errors collection or alternatively raise an exception. You should only add to the errors collection if you expect the caller to handle the error.

You should note that the value returned from the perform method is discarded. This encourages the caller to make use of the public accessor methods to access the results of the operation.

#### The alternative `perform!` method

The `perform!` method works in a similar manner to the ActiveRecord `save!` method. Should a validation or other error occur, an exception is raised. This method should be used in scenarios where the caller does not expect any errors to occur. One example of this is when the parameters have been pre-checked by a controller class or similar.

### Post-execution

During the `perform` method, you should have stored the results as instance variables. You would normally make these publicly accessible using a `attr_reader` method declaration. You should avoid declaring public methods that further process the output of the `perform` method.

#### Checking for errors

The caller can check the success or failure of the use case by calling the `success?` and `failure?` helper methods. If the use case has had a failure, the errors will be available on the standard `errors` collection.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, update `CHANGELOG.md`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
